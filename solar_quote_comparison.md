- **Expiration:** Scheduled to reduce after 2032 (currently 30% through 2032).

### Maryland State Incentives
- **Residential Clean Energy Grant Program:**
  - **Amount:** $1,000 for solar + $3,000 for battery storage (subject to funding)
  - **Requirement:** Must use a certified installer and meet system specifications
  - **Process:** Apply within 12 months of installation completion

- **SREC Program (Solar Renewable Energy Certificates):**
  - **What:** Earn certificates for every 1 MWh generated
  - **Sellable Credits:** Can be sold to utilities in the market for additional income
  - **Registration Required:** Typically handled by your installer or aggregator

- **Property Tax Exemption:**
  - Solar installations are **exempt from state and local property tax** assessments

**Bottom Line:**
These incentives can reduce your upfront system cost by **30–50%**, improve cash flow, and significantly shorten payback time. Most are available only if you **own** the system, not through leases or PPAs.
